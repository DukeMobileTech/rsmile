Dear participant,
<p>Thank you for participating in the SMILE research study.</p>
<p>You are receiving this because you have at least 1 remaining invitation open.</p>
<p>You can invite up to 2 people. For each person you invite who successfully 
  completes the survey, you will receive a small payment of $2 [specific to country], 
  and the person completing the survey will receive a small payment ($1 [specific to 
  each country]) as well.
</p>
<p>You have one more week to invite people to participate in the study. If you have 
  already sent the survey link to people, it could be that they have not yet finished 
  the survey, or that they declined to participate, or that they tried but were not 
  eligible to take the survey (because they previously participated, or did not fit 
  the study participant criteria). Please remind your contacts to participate using 
  the link below.
</p>
<p>Please share the link below with them. This invitation link is specific to you 
  and they should not forward it to other people.
