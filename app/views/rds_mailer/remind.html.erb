Dear participant,
<p>Thank you for participating in the SMILE research study.</p>
<p>When you completed the survey, you stated that you may be willing to recruit other people to take the survey.</p>
<p>
  You can recruit up to 2 people. For each person you recruit who
  successfully completes the survey, you will receive a small payment of $2, 
  and the person completing the survey will receive a small payment as well.
</p>
<p>
  You have 1 more week to invite people to participate in the study. 
  If you have already sent the survey link to people, it could be that 
  they have not yet finished the survey, or that they declined to participate, 
  or that they tried but were not eligible to take the survey (because they 
  previously participated, or did not fit the study participant criteria). 
  Please remind your contacts to participate using the link below.
