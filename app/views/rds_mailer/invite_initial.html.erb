Dear participant,
<p>Thank you for participating in the SMILE research study.</p>
<p>When you completed the survey, you stated that you may be willing to invite other 
  people to take the survey. If you do not want to invite anyone, you can ignore this

<p>You can invite up to 2 people. For each person you invite who successfully 
  completes the survey, you will receive a small payment of <%= @participant.recruitment_amount %>, 
  and the person completing the survey will receive a small payment 
  (<%= @participant.survey_amount %>) as well.
