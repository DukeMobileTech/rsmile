Dear participant,
<p>Thank you for participating in the SMILE research study. You still have remaining survey invitations.</p>
<p>You have 1 more week to invite people to participate in the study. 
  If you have already sent the survey link to people, it could be that they have not yet finished the survey, 
  or that they declined to participate, or that they tried but were not eligible to take the survey 
  (because they previously participated, or did not fit the study participant criteria). 
  Please remind your contacts to participate using the link below.</p>
<p>For each of the people you recruit who successfully completes the survey (up to 2 people), you will receive $2,
  and the person completing the survey will receive a small payment as well.
</p>
