Dear participant,
<p>Thank you for participating in the SMILE Study.</p>
<p>When you completed the survey, you agreed to recruit other sexual and gender minority (LGBTQ+) participants who identify as
  <b><%= @participant.sgm_group_label %></b> to also take the survey.</p>
<p>For each of the people you recruit who successfully completes the survey (up to 2 people), you will receive $2.</p>
<p>Please let each person know in your own words about the survey, and that they can learn more about it by clicking on their invitation link.</p>
<p>
  <b>Please note:</b>
  The link below is different from the one you used to start your survey. Please only use this link to invite others to take their survey.
</p>
<p>You can recruit other people by sharing with them the following link:</p>
<p><%= Rails.application.credentials.config[:invitation_url] %>?referrer_code=<%= @participant.code %></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><%= Rails.application.credentials.config[:from_name] %>
  (<%= Rails.application.credentials.config[:from_name_alt] %>) and
  <%= Rails.application.credentials.config[:from_email] %>
  (<%= Rails.application.credentials.config[:from_phone] %>)</p>
<p>On behalf of the SMILE Team</p>
